## Context

This section was created as a response to the callout from Dom (Solana team member) on 06-Dec-2020 to all the Mainnet Beta OG's to share their experience and knowledge by running few recorded Solana Validator workshops so as to help the newer folks coming on-board.

The tentative timeline is 2021 New Year.

## Structure

The draft strucuture suggested by Dom is as such. And we may continue to expand based on the validator community needs ...so suggestions are most welcome.

1) **Basic level**, daemon settings, systemd configuration ( extra flags and options, like when you need to fetch and when you not, genesis no genesis and so on ), installation recommendations, dependency, compile tricks ( is plenty apparently like rust version comparability ), hardware cons and pros.

2) **Log analysis**, explain events in a log stream. The speed I personally gain this knowledge about log is ridiculously slow, not sure if everyone in competition or what, but sharing information is not a cup of tea in chats around, which is ok everyone on they own.

3) **Grafana**, graphs explanation and log comparison with events on the graphs, methods how to get this data from console like root for example.
